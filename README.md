# life-Expectancy-Data-Analysis


Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person is expected to live based on the statistical average. It is a measure that summarizes the mortality of a country, allowing us to compare it by generations and analyze trends. It depends on the geographical context of the area. There is no better indicator of a country's social development than having a long and healthy life. Life expectancy expansion is a result of, among other things, improvements in nutrition, health and, above all, a decrease in mortality.
Period life expectancy (PLE) is one of the most used summary indicators for the overall health of a population. It is based on the set of observed age-specific death rates, i.e., the number of deaths in a certain year and age group divided by the average number of people alive in this year and age group.
